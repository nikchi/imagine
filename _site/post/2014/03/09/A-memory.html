<h2>So I just got back from the kitchen</h2>

<p>I microwaved a cup of milk (80z to be exact) and mixed in some starbucks hot cocoa into it. I had a croissant with it. 
The croissant was from costco.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">And now I launch into a large rambling
</code></pre></div>
<p>Something about the combination of the food and the time made me remember something from a couple months ago, when I was still working QA at Saks. Saks had a timesheet system, which meant you had to punch in and out. Now they would not do overtime for interns (or maybe hourly?) so anything over 40 hours was frowned upon. You&#39;d think, &quot;oh, get in at 9 punch-out at 5&quot; but lunch wasn&#39;t paid any you had to punch out. A typical day for the interns would be 9-6 because of that, if you took the full hour for lunch.</p>

<p>My commute was nearly an hour on an express bus, and if I left at 6 then that would mean I&#39;d get home at 8, which sucks. So I got into the habit of getting in early and taking short lunches. A typical day would be, clock in at 8:40, work til whenever I decided lunch was (which was when everyone else went to lunch), clock out, then clock back in maybe 10-15 minutes later having gotten lunch from someplace called freshday. Then clock out at whenever time would make my day 8 hours. It worked well for the entire time I was there. I always had some work in the morning, overnight regressions, emails from the dev team (who generally liked a 10-7 schedule more), checking on bug fix progress and that jazz. So I wasn&#39;t there just sitting around most days. And the managers would come in later too, except for the QA top brass, Rey. He would be there early, almost every day. Somedays I&#39;d come in at 8:30 and he&#39;d be there already.</p>

<p>Anyway, 2 or so weeks into the internship, half day fridays came into play. Saks had this thing where fridays were half days but you were paid for the full 8 hours. Pretty sweet huh? BUT for interns and hourly, you&#39;d have to come in at 8:00 to qualify to leave early. Nevertheless, I got up early to get to work early to leave, early. </p>

<p>Every so often though, I&#39;d get up early on say a wednesday, and get to work way early. Too early sometimes, maybe because I might&#39;ve worked for 8.5 hours on monday and tuesday, putting me an hour ahead. </p>

<p>So I&#39;d get breakfast. </p>

<p>Breakfast meant Au Bon Pain (which was also lunch occasionally). It was on the way from the bus stop to work, so it was a good place to get breakfast if any. Now here comes the paragraphs which I try to be descriptive.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a cool summer morning, not baking hot yet, but the temperature reminds you of the coming heat. Theres a wetness in the air that make you think it&#39;ll be humid later on. You walk into au bon pain and you feel the AC wash over you. You smell baked goods, not overwhelming like they were fresh from the oven, but close. 
You buy a croissant and a cup of coffee, and you go over to sit by the window. Outside, a light blue covers everything, it&#39;s eerie in a nice way. The sun maybe just only peeked up 20 minutes ago. You eat your croissant as the people behind you pay for their purchases and the people in front of you outside walk at a nyc pace.
You finish your croissant in 3 minutes, taking some sips of coffee in between. Then you sit there and watch the people speedwalk past as the blue starts to fade outside. After 5 minutes you grab your coffee and walk outside to go join the rest of them.</p>

<p>Now that I look back at it, I can&#39;t remember any of the sounds, just the ambient mood. I hope I conveyed it well enough through words. I don&#39;t think I did these morning au bon pain runs much over the summer, and I regret not doing it more. It probably wasn&#39;t the food or coffee but the morning haze (from tired self and the actual morning), combined with the ominously chilly-warmness of outside and the cool AC change that made it so memorable.</p>

<p>Ok thanks for reading.</p>
